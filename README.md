# Quantum Evolution Kernel

A Python library that implements Quantum Evolution Kernel, a method for measuring the
similarity between graph-structured data, based on the time-evolution of a quantum system.
It includes an example application in machine learning classification on a bio-chemical dataset.

For more details about the approach, see https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.107.042615

## Installation

### Using `hatch`, `uv` or any pyproject-compatible Python manager

Edit file `pyproject.toml` to add the line

```toml
  "quantum-evolution-kernel"
```

to the list of `dependencies`.

### Using `pip` or `pipx`
To install the `pipy` package using `pip` or `pipx`

1. Create a `venv` if that's not done yet

```sh
$ python -m venv venv

```

2. Enter the venv

```sh
$ . venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the package

```sh
$ pip install quantum-evolution-kernel
# or
$ pipx install quantum-evolution-kernel
```

## QuickStart

```python
# Load a dataset
import torch_geometric.datasets as pyg_dataset
og_ptcfm = pyg_dataset.TUDataset(root="dataset", name="PTC_FM")

# Setup a quantum feature extractor for this dataset.
# In this example, we'll use QutipExtractor, to emulate a Quantum Device on our machine.
import qek.data.graphs as qek_graphs
import qek.data.extractors as qek_extractors
extractor = qek_extractors.QutipExtractor(compiler=qek_graphs.PTCFMCompiler())

# Add the graphs, compile them and look at the results.
extractor.add_graphs(graphs=og_ptcfm)
extractor.compile()
processed_dataset = extractor.run().processed_data

# Prepare a machine learning pipeline with Scikit Learn.
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.svm import SVC

X = [data for data in processed_dataset]  # Features
y = [data.target for data in processed_dataset]  # Targets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, stratify = y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a kernel
from qek.kernel import QuantumEvolutionKernel as QEK
kernel = QEK(mu=0.5)
model = SVC(kernel=kernel, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```
