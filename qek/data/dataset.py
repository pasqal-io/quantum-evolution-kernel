class ProcessedData:
    """
    Data on a single graph obtained from the Quantum Device.

    Attributes:
        sequence: The sequence, derived from the graph geometry,
            executed on the device.
        state_dict: A dictionary {bitstring: number of instances}
            for this graph.
        target: The target, i.e. the identifier of the graph.

    The state dictionary represents an approximation of the quantum
    state of the device for this graph after completion of the
    algorithm.

    - keys are bitstrings, i.e. strings of N time 0 or 1, where N
      is the number of qubits, i.e. the number of nodes in the graph.
      Each of these {0, 1} corresponds to a possible state for the
      corresponding qubit.
    - values are the number of samples observed with this specific
      state of the register.

    The sum of all values for the dictionary is equal to the total
    number of samples observed on the quantum device (for this
    specific graph).
