    "## 1) Dataset Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "As with any machine learning task, the first step is to load and prepare the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "QEK (Quantum-Enhanced Kernel) can work with various types of graphs. In this tutorial, we will use a generic synthetic graph dataset. The dataset will be generated using the `networkx` library, and we will incorporate features and target values to facilitate a classification task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Graph Generation**: We will create a synthetic graph using `networkx` and `torch_geometric` dataset.\n",
    "- **Assigning Node and Edge Features**: Each node and edge will be assigned relevant features.\n",
    "- **Target Value Assignment**: The target value for each graph will be based on its density. This value will be used in a classification task.\n",
    "- **Defining Graph Geometry**\n",
    "   - A generic grid-like geometry will be assigned.\n",
    "   - The positions of nodes will be stored in the `pos` variable.\n",
    "   - Users can define custom positions, ensuring compatibility with the QPU register.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Customization and Considerations\n",
    "- Users can modify the node and edge features as needed.\n",
    "- Custom graph layouts should be carefully designed to maintain compatibility with quantum processing unit (QPU)/mulator registers.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, we will prepare a dataset suitable for quantum-enhanced graph machine learning tasks.\n",
