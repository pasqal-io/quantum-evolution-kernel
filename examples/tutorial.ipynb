It combines two important aspects: how precise the model is (how many of the predicted positives are actually positive) and how well it captures all the actual positives (recall). It provides a single number that balances these two aspects, making it useful for evaluating performance in real-world scenarios where some categories are much more common than others.\n",

Instead of just looking at overall accuracy, which can be misleading in such cases, balanced accuracy considers how well the model performs for each category separately and then averages these performances. This ensures that the evaluation is not skewed by the more common categories, giving a more honest picture of the model's effectiveness across all categories.\n",
