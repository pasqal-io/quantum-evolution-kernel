    "### Introduction\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems capable of learning from data to make predictions or decisions. A common ML task is classification, where we try to assign labels to data points. In this tutorial, we will use the **Quantum Evolution Kernel**, a custom kernel that computes the similarity between graph-structured data to model a classification problem using Support Vector Machine (SVM) on graph dataset.\n",

    "1. Loading and preprocessing a dataset for kernel-based machine learning.\n",

    "3. Training and evaluating a **Support Vector Machine** (SVM) using the Quantum Evolution Kernel.\n",
    "4. Integrating the kernel and SVM into a scikit-learn **Pipeline** for streamlined workflows.\n",
    "5. Performing hyperparameter optimization using **GridSearchCV** to improve model performance.\n",
