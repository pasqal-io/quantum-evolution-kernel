    "The companion library is a machine-learning tool that uses a quantum device to predict similarities and properties of graphs. In this tutorial, we will reproduce first part of the [QEK paper](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.107.042615) using the library's high-level API. The high-level goal of this tutorial is to predict toxicity properties of molecules, using quantum machine learning, but of course, the mechanisms involved are much more generic.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will know how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Setup import for a molecular dataset (the library supports other type of graphs, of course).\n",
    "2. Setup compilation and execution of these graphs for execution on a Quantum Device (either an emulator or a physical QPU).\n",
    "3. Launch the execution and extract the relevant machine-learning features.\n",
    "\n",
    "A [companion notebook](./tutorial%202%20-%20Machine-Learning%20with%20the%20Quantum%20EvolutionKernel.ipynb) will guide you through machine-learning with QEK.\n",
    "\n",
    "If, instead of using the library's high-level API, you prefer digging a bit closer to the qubits, you may prefer the companion [low-level notebook](./tutorial%201a%20-%20Using%20a%20Quantum%20Device%20to%20Extract%20Machine-Learning%20Features%20-%20low-level.ipynb) that mirrors this notebook, but using a lower-level API that will let you experiment with different quantum pulses."
