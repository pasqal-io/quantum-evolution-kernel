# Quantum Extraction

These tutorials will teach you how to use the quantum APIs for feature-extraction:

1. [Using a Quantum Device to extract machine-learning features (high-level)](https://github.com/pasqal-io/quantum-evolution-kernel/blob/main/examples/tutorial%201%20-%20Using%20a%20Quantum%20Device%20to%20Extract%20Machine-Learning%20Features.ipynb);
2. [Using a Quantum Device to extract machine-learning features (low-level)](https://github.com/pasqal-io/quantum-evolution-kernel/blob/main/examples/tutorial%201a%20-%20Using%20a%20Quantum%20Device%20to%20Extract%20Machine-Learning%20Features%20-%20low-level.ipynb);
