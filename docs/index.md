# "Quantum Evolution Kernel"


The Quantum Evolution Kernel is a Python library designed for the machine learning community to help users design quantum-driven similarity metrics for graphs and to use them inside kernel-based machine learning algorithms for graph data.

The core of the library is focused on the development of a classification algorithm for molecular-graph dataset as it is presented in the published paper _Quantum feature maps for graph machine learning on a neutral atom quantum processor_ ([Journal Paper](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.107.042615), [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03247)).


Users setting their first steps into quantum computing will learn how to implement the core algorithm in a few simple steps and run it using the Pasqal Neutral Atom QPU. More experienced users will find this library to provide the right environment to explore new ideas - both in terms of methodologies and data domain - while always interacting with a simple and intuitive QPU interface.

## Getting started

You should probably start with [our Quickstart guide](./usage.md).

After that, we provide [several tutorials](./tutorial%201%20-%20Using%20a%20Quantum%20Device%20to%20Extract%20Machine-Learning%20Features.ipynb).
